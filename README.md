# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project - Test a Perceptual Phenomenon


## Introduction

In this project, you will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. You will learn a
little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself.
You will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results.
Finally, you will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses.
